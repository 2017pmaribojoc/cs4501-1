Overview
========

This project is set up to introduce to you a technology called Docker.
Docker will be used throughout the semester and that is the reason we set up this preliminary project.
If you intend to take this course, we encourage you to finish (at least look at it) before the school starts.
This will be helpful for you in terms of the first project where we do some more complicated stuff with Docker.

Docker First Encounter
----------------------
Docker is a system for managing Linux containers. You can read more about them elsewhere, but they're like a virtual machione but lighter weight. You can define what kind of environment you need, install apps, and then easily clone/start as many instances of that container as you like -- on your dev machine or on public hosting providers like Amazon AWS.

You will start to appreciate the beauty of Docker and the idea of Infrastructure as Software more and more as we progress in the semester. For now, you can think of Docker as a solution to manage environment that you software runs in. Docker encapsulates the specific version of Django, Database setup, etc so that you can you can esily replicate your software on any machine. You can think of Docker as a physical machines but in the form of software.
